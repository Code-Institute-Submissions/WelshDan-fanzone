### A social media site for football fans

##### The goal with Fanzone
The goal with Fanzone was to create a simple social media site with the usual
post, comment and like functions but with the twist of being able to support a
specific team to also see a feed with only posts about that certain team.

### Design


### Icons and images

#### Font and colour schemes

##### Font

My two main choices of font were the Oxygen Mono and the Open Sans fonts:

(Insert font-oxygen-mono image) (insert font-open-sans image)

I chose the Oxygen Mono font as I felt it was simple and clean but a little
relaxed at the same time.

Throughout the app I have used Oxygen Mono as the chosen font and have the
sans-serif as the default backup font.


##### Colour

I chose the colour green as the dominant colour to represent the colour of grass
and so to feel like the background was similar to a football pitch.

There were a few other colours involved during the planning process.

On deciding on the colour green I then chose between a few shades of green.

(insert 4fb076) (insert b5e61d) (insert 4ff10e)

I chose this shade of green felt energetic. #B5E61D

#### Fanzone Logo

![fanzone logo](./frontend/src/assets/logo.png)

The Favicon logo was designed by myself using Microsoft Paint and using a
ball image shrunk down.

I wanted to keep the theme of green and thought the brighter green was energetic
and I felt the logo was more appealing with white text as opposed to black text.


#### Fanzone Favicon

![fanzone favicon](./frontend/public/favicon-16x16.png)

The Favicon was created using [favicon generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/)

The green is the same used in the logo and also with white text.
