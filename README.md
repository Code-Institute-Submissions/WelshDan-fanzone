### A social media site for football fans

-----

### The goal with Fanzone
The goal with Fanzone was to create a simple social media site with the usual
post, comment and like functions but with the twist of being able to support a
specific team to also see a feed with only posts about that certain team.

## 1. Planning

### Functionality

The aim of the website was to use a standard modern design using icon to
simplify and with as few pages as possible.
Users can perform the CRUD functions of create, read, update and delete in many
parts of the website.

## 2. App Layout

### Design




#### Data Model

I started from a few drawings of a flowchart and by using the free flowchart
maker from the website [Canva](https://www.canva.com/online-whiteboard/flowcharts/)
the design was set.

### Icons and images

Fanzone Icon designed in Microsoft Paint:

### Font and colour schemes

#### Font

My two main choices of font were:

The Oxygen Mono

![Screenshot of example text in Oxygen Mono font](/readme-images/font-oxygen-mono.jpg)

and the Open Sans fonts

![Screenshot of example text in Open Sans font](/readme-images/font-open-sans.jpg)

I chose the Oxygen Mono font as I felt it was simple and clean but a little
relaxed at the same time.

Throughout the app I have used Oxygen Mono as the chosen font and have the
sans-serif as the default backup font.


#### Colour

I chose the colour green as the dominant colour to represent the colour of grass
and so to feel like the background was similar to a football pitch.

There were a few other colours involved during the planning process.

On deciding on the colour green I then chose between a few shades of green.

![Screenshot of a colour wheel with the color #b5e61d](/readme-images/b5e61d.jpg)

I chose this shade of green felt energetic. #B5E61D

#### Fanzone Logo

![fanzone logo](/readme-images/logo.jpg)

The Favicon logo was designed by myself using Microsoft Paint and using a
ball image shrunk down.

I wanted to keep the theme of green and thought the brighter green was energetic
and I felt the logo was more appealing with white text as opposed to black text.


#### Fanzone Favicon

![fanzone favicon](/readme-images/favicon-16x16.png)

The Favicon was created using [favicon generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/)

The green is the same used in the logo and also with white text.

## 4. Installation

## 5. Usage

**Starting up the app from IDE**

Starting of the app required two terminals open
1. Starting Django from the backend
2. Starting React js from the frontend.

To start the app, I started with these codes in terminal 1:

To change directory to Fanzone/frontend
```
cd frontend
```

Then to start React
```
npm start
```

Then to start Django in terminal 1:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

The website was then run using Port: 3000 which is the connected to the
frontend.
